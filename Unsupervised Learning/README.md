## Introduction
Unsupervised learning is a branch of machine learning that is used to find underlying patterns in data and 
is often used in exploratory data analysis. Unsupervised learning does not use labeled data like supervised learning, 
but instead focuses on the dataâ€™s features. Labeled training data has a corresponding output for each input. 
When using unsupervised learning, we are not concerned with the targeted outputs because the goal of the 
algorithm is to find relationships within the data and group data points based on the input data alone.
