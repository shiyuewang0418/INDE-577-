# Project Description
The whole project is about the application of alogrithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning on the data sets, then performance and error analysis is conducted on each algorithm.
# Repository Description
For this repository, each sub-repository is named by an algorithm name, and it contains a .ipynb file which illustrates and impliments algorithms/applications/visualizations learned in that week, a README file which gives a description of algorithms used, and sub-repositories of dataset(if applicable).

Programming language used in this repository is Python 3.

# Algorithms Covered

* Principal Component Analysis(PCA)
* K-Means
## Supervised Learning
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Perceptron
* Multilayer Neural Network
* Decision Tree
* Ensemble Learning: Random Forest(bagging)
* Ensemble Learning: Boosting

# Dataset
For this project, I used Wheat-seeds data from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jmcaro/wheat-seedsuci).
This dataset contains seed information belonging to three different wheat varieties: Kama, Rosa and Canadian, 
represented by 1, 2 and 3 respectively. It has 8 columns which represent 8 variables, I mainly uses Type, Kernel.Groove, Kernel.Width and kernel.Length for this project.
Also, for Multilayer Neural Network, I used MNIST dataset. The dataset has 60,000 training data with 28x28 grayscale images and 10,000 test images. Images are labeled over 10 categories. The pixel depth allows 255 different intensities, with 0 being black and 255 being white. And the classes are: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boot with labels 0 to 9 respectively.
