# Project Description
The whole project is about the application of alogrithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning on the data sets, then performance and error analysis is conducted on each algorithm.
# Repository Description
For this repository, each sub-repository is named by an algorithm name, and it contains a .ipynb file which illustrates and impliments algorithms/applications/visualizations learned in that week, a README file which gives a description of algorithms used, and sub-repositories of dataset(if applicable).

Programming language used in this repository is Python 3.
