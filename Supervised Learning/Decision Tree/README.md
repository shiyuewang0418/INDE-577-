## Definition
The decision tree algorithm works based on the decision on the conditions of the features. 
Nodes are the conditions or tests on an attribute, branch represents the outcome of the tests, 
and leaf nodes are the decisions based on the conditions.


n decision analysis, a decision tree and the closely related influence diagram are used as a visual and 
analytical decision support tool, where the expected values (or expected utility) of competing alternatives are calculated.

## Advantages
* Easy to use and understand.
* Can handle both categorical and numerical data.
* Resistant to outliers, hence require little data preprocessing.

## Disadvantages
* Prone to overfitting.
* Require some kind of measurement as to how well they are doing.
* Need to be careful with parameter tuning.
* Can create biased learned trees if some classes dominate.
