## Definition
In machine learning, the Perceptron algorithm is a two-class (binary) classification algorithm. 
Binary classification is a form of classification, the process of predicting categorical variables, 
where the output is restricted to two classes, and it can be used in many data science field. 
It is a type of neural network model, perhaps the simplest type of neural network model. 
It consists of a single node or neuron that takes a row of data as input and predicts a class label
