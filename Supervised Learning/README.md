## Definition
Supervised learning is a technique in which we teach or train the machine using data which is well labeled. 
Here, system is presented with data which is correctly labeled and the task is to predict the output (Y) 
with help of provided data for new input data (X).

## Algorithms Covered
* Perceptron
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Multilayer Neural networks
* K-Nearest Neighbor
* Decision Tree
* Ensemble Method: Random Forest(Bagging),Boosting
